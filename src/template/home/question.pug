  +question('What is the Miner?', 'The Miner is a general purpose crypto mining device. It is designed to power the next generation of blockchains, including Proof-of-Stake blockchains (such as Ethereum) and Layer 2 blockchains (such as Bitcoin Lightning Network).  It can mine multiple cryptocurrencies at the same time.')
  +question('Why is the Miner so much more efficient than traditional mining?', 'Traditional mining relies on an energy-guzzling mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). Most major blockchains have now made upgrades to Proof of Stake (PoS) - a much more efficient system. By running only the latest PoS blockchains, the Miner is able to earn you cryptocurrency for less energy than it takes to power your desktop.')
  +question('What is Proof of Stake?', 'Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depends on a validator\'s economic stake in the network. In proof of work (PoW) based public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and the current implementation of Ethereum), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining). In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum\'s upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator\'s vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency.')
  +question('How much money can I make?', 'It’s hard to give an exact answer. It depends on the price and amount of the cryptocurrencies you’re mining with the Miner.  We believe a number of cryptocurrencies will go up significantly in price over time, as they prove their values and use cases.')
  +question('How did you build the Miner?', 'The Miner comes with a simple device and a mobile app.  Just simply plug the device in, connect it to Wifi, and let it work for you.  The app lets you manage your Miner from anywhere.  You can manage multiple Miners in the same app.')
  +question('Which blockchains will you support?', 'We aim to support most Proof-of-Stake blockchains and Layer 2 networks, starting with the most active ones:  Lightning Network (Bitcoin), Ethereum 2.0 (Ether), Harmony Network (One), and Incognito (Privacy).')
  +question('When will the Miner ship?', 'The Miner will begin shipping in September, with priority for pre-orders.')
  +question('How can I get early bird pricing?', 'To be the first to know when early bird prices are live, please subscribe to the early bird special.')
  +question('How much electricity does it consume?', 'The miner is very energy efficient.  At maximum capacity, it consumers ~1.5 kWh a day.  On average, it consumes less than ~1 kWh a day.  In the US, that’s about $0.08 a day.')
  +question('What is the hash rate of the Miner?', 'Hash rate is a performance indicator for Proof-of-Work blockchains.  Most major blockchains have now made upgrades to Proof-of-Stake.  The Miner is designed specifically for Proof-of-Stake blockchains, such as Ethereum 2.0, and layer 2 networks, such as Bitcoin Lightning Network.')
  +question('What is the return policy?', 'If you don’t love your Miner, simply return it within 30 days for a full refund.  No questions asked.')
  +question('Which countries is the Miner available in?', 'We ship the Miner internationally through our warehouse partners in California (US), New York (US), Toronto (Canada), Shenzhen (China), Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), Amsterdam (Europe).')
  +question('How long does it take to set up the Miner?', 'Plug it in. Connect to WiFi.  Let it run.  That’s it!')
  +question('How quiet is the Miner?', 'The Miner is extremely quiet, even when it operates at maximum capacity.  You can set up the Miner anywhere. On the kitchen counter, in your bedroom, or in the office.')
