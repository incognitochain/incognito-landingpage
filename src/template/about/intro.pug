        h1.heading What we do
        h1.title We build the privacy layer of the decentralized web.
        p.sub-title If youâ€™re here reading this, you already know how fast crypto assets are changing the way we think about money.
        p.sub-title For those who value privacy, crypto assets come with a big tradeoff. Transactions are recorded on public ledgers, displaying amounts involved, inscribing virtual identities of their senders and receivers.
