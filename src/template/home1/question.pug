    +question('What is Node?', 'Node is a plug-and-play crypto generating device. Designed to power the Incognito network, a privacy blockchain that enables confidential transfer of crypto assets, it validates confidential transactions and proposes new blocks. In return, it earns cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH. Node also earns Privacy, the native coin of Incognito.')
    +question('Why is Node so much more efficient than traditional mining?', 'Traditional mining relies on an energy-guzzling mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). Most major blockchains have now made upgrades to Proof of Stake (PoS) - a much more efficient system. By running only the latest PoS blockchains, Node is able to earn you cryptocurrency for less energy than it takes to power your desktop.')
    +question('How much money can I make?', 'It’s hard to give an exact answer. It depends on the price and amount of the cryptocurrencies you’re mining with Node. We believe a number of cryptocurrencies will go up significantly in price over time, as they prove their values and use cases.')
    +question('What’s in the box?', 'Node is a simple device. It comes with a power cord and a free mobile app. Just plug the device in, connect it to the app, and let Node work for you. The app is available for Android and iOS devices, and allows you to manage your Node and keep track of your earnings from anywhere in the world.')
    +question('When will Node ship?', 'Node will begin shipping in late October with priority for pre-orders.')
    +question('How can I get early bird pricing?', 'To be the first to know when early bird prices are live, please subscribe to the early bird special.')
    +question('How much electricity does it consume?', 'Node is very energy efficient. At maximum capacity, it consumers ~1.5 kWh a day. On average, it consumes less than ~1 kWh a day. In the US, that’s about $0.08 a day.')
    +question('What is the hash rate of Node?', 'Zero. Hash rate is a performance indicator for Proof-of-Work blockchains. Node is designed for Proof-of-Stake blockchains, so hash rate is irrelevant. Most major blockchains have now made upgrades to Proof-of-Stake. Node is designed specifically for Proof-of-Stake blockchains, such as Ethereum 2.0, and layer 2 networks, such as Bitcoin Lightning Network.')
    +question('What is the return policy?', 'If you don’t love your Node, simply return it within 30 days for a full refund. No questions asked.')
    +question('Which countries are Node available in?', 'Node ships worldwide and ships quickly through our international warehouse partners in North America, Europe and Asia')
    +question('How long does it take to set up Node?', 'Plug it in. Connect to WiFi. Let it run. That’s it!')
    +question('How quiet is Node?', 'Node is extremely quiet, even when it operates at maximum capacity. You can set up Node anywhere. On the kitchen counter, in your bedroom, or in the office.')
    +question('Which currencies can Node earn?', 'Node earns Incognito’s native coin, Privacy (PRV), for every block created. Earn pieces of the network for helping to build it. Since Node powers incognito mode for multiple blockchains, it can collect transaction fees in multiple cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, BNB, and more). Collect the most promising coins of today and tomorrow.')
