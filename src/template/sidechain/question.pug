  +question('What is the Incognito Sidechain?', 'Incognito Sidechain is the first blockchain with privacy at its core.  It works seamlessly with other blockchains, allowing you to send and receive BTC, ETH, USDT and more - with complete confidentiality.')
  +question('Can I mint my own privacy token?', 'Yes.  Anyone can create their own privacy token on the Incognito blockchain.')
  +question('What is Privacy (PRV)?', 'Privacy (PRV) is Incognitoâ€™s native coin, a work token.  In order to be a miner on the Incognito network, you need to stake Privacy. Everyone who owns Privacy can help build the network, and in return, own a piece of its income.')
  +question('What do you mean by staking Privacy?', 'Incognito implements Proof of Stake (PoS).  PoS is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depends on a validator\'s economic stake in the network. In proof of work (PoW) based public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining). In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Incognito and Ethereum 2.0), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator\'s vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency.')
  +question('What are the blockchains that work with Incognito?', 'We will prioritize integrations with the Ethereum blockchain and Bitcoin blockchain.  At launch, you will be able to send BTC, ETH, and any ERC20 tokens privately. Incognito is designed to work with any blockchain, and integrations with other blockchains will be added over time.  We plan to build as many integrations as possible.')
